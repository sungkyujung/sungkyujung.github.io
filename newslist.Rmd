This manuscript is part II of [the 2017 EJS paper](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ejs/1491292817), in which we addressed only 2 x 2 and 3 x 3 matrices. The current paper addresses dimensions $p\ge 4$. The link to this article is [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.difgeo.2021.101798).

This answers a fundamental question in directional statistics: If a von Mises-Fisher distributed random direction is projected onto a geodesic, it is still von Mises distributed?

2020-12-19. The manuscript ["Covariance-engaged Classification of Sets via Linear Programming"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14831) is accepted for publication in *Statistica Sinica*.

We thought a proper response was due. This letter will appear in AOAS. (It appeared in two months: [Here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/20-AOAS1411) is the link.)

2020-10-06. I am selected to receive a prestigious five-year [**research grant from Samsung Science & Technology Foundation**](http://www.samsungstf.org/ssrfPr/researcher/viewResearcher.do?idx=444&pageIndex=1&searchCondition=all&searchKeyword=%EC%A0%95%EC%84%B1%EA%B7%9C&searchResearchProgram=%EA%B8%B0%EC%B4%88%EA%B3%BC%ED%95%99&searchResearchDepth1=&searchResearchDepth2=&searchResearchBelong=&searchResearchSelectYear=&searchResearchState=).

The manuscript "[Adjusting systematic bias in high dimensional principal component scores](https://doi.org/10.5705/ss.202019.0400)," written by myself is accepted for publication in *Statistica Sinica*. *Statistica Sinica* is notorious for its long interval between the acceptance and print. 

2020-08-30. A video explaining my research interest is on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhlLZix8JPI). This is a part of the CNS series of promoting research agendas. Intended viewers are prospective graduate students. 

2020-08-07. The manuscript "[Covariate-driven factorization by thresholding for multi-block data](https://doi.org/10.1111/biom.13352)" is accepted for publication in *Biometrics*.

[(link)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047259X19306141) This work is part of Byungwon's PhD dissertation, but changes since then are enormous. The issues addressed and raised in this paper lead to a promising research direction on projection pursuit for directional data. 

2019-09-06. I have received [**Excellence in Teaching Award**](./pictures/2019_9_teaching_award.jpg) from the College of Natural Science. Thanks!

2019-08-08. I am now an associate editor of *Computational Statistics & Data Analysis*.

2019-02-20. I am selected to receive a five-year **mid-career research grant from National Research Foundation**. The proposed topic is on high-dimensional and non-Euclidean statistics. 

2018-12-18. The manuscript "Small sphere distributions for directional data with application to medical imaging" by Stephan, Joern, Byungwon and myself is accepted for publication in  *Scandinavian Journal of Statistics*. [(link)](https://doi.org/10.1111/sjos.12381) This work began its life in 2015 from a query from Steve Marron (Is there a parametric distribution for small-circle behavior of data?). Stephan and I sent a preliminary version of this to a conference, then decided not to publish. Byungwon took over and has created a nice family of distributions on hyperspheres, called "Small sphere distributions". This is a part of his PhD dissertation.

2018-10-30. My contribution to the Korean Statistical Society newsletter is now in print. It's about data science education (from the statistical perspective) and is written in Korean. You can see it [here](http://www.kss.or.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=newsletter&wr_id=113) but the online version is only for members.

2018-10-10. As a new faculty member of Seoul National University, I did an interview introducing myself  [(link)](http://science.snu.ac.kr/bbs/view.php?board_id=kor_profnews&idx=311&m=4&gul_no=6817&page=1). 

2018-10-09. The manuscript "Penalized Orthogonal Iteration for Sparse Estimation of Generalized Eigenvalue Problem" by Prfessors Jeon and Ahn, and myself, is accepted for publication in *Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics*. [(link)](https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2019.1568014)

2018-09-01. I have officially joined the department of Statistics at Seoul National University.

# BadNews

2022-11-17. I was not selected to be a member of Young Korean Academy of Science and Technology. Disappointed, but okay. 

2022-05-11. My team and I were not selected to receive a research grant from IITP on an application of differential privacy. In addition, a different team including me was not selected to receive a basic research lab grant from NRF on the statistical foundation of differential privacy. 

2020-10-22. I have decided not to pursue a publication of Lee and Jung (2017). This paper is part of Sungwon's doctoral dissertation, and has been considered for a couple of journals with mixed responses. The work has drawn some attention from researchers (with nontrivial Google Scholar citation numbers). The effort I need to put in to publish this in an established journal outweighs the merit of the paper. This paper will remain as an [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01775) paper.
