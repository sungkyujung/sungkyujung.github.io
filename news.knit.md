The issues addressed and raised in this paper lead to a promising research direction on projection pursuit for directional data. </td>

[(link)](https://doi.org/10.1111/sjos.12381) This work began its life in 2015 from a query from Steve Marron (Is there a parametric distribution for small-circle behavior of data?). Stephan and I sent a preliminary version of this to a conference, then decided not to publish. Byungwon took over and has created a nice family of distributions on hyperspheres, called "Small sphere distributions". This is a part of his PhD dissertation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> I have decided not to pursue a publication of Lee and Jung (2017). This paper is part of Sungwon's doctoral dissertation, and has been considered for a couple of journals with mixed responses. The work has drawn some attention from researchers (with nontrivial Google Scholar citation numbers). The effort I need to put in to publish this in an established journal outweighs the merit of the paper. This paper will remain as an [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01775) paper. </td>
