in Korean, and discusses the use of bootstrap in testing equality of
distributions based on privatized histograms.</p>
<p>2021-09-10. I have received <a
href="./pictures/2021_9_researchaward.PNG"><strong>Research
Award</strong></a> from the College of Natural Science, Seoul National
University. Thanks!</p>
<p>2021-09-01. Welcome Taehyun Kim, a new masters student,
Dr. Jongkyeong Kang and Dr. Seung Woo Kwak to the lab. Dr. Kang from
Korea Univ. will investigate multi-source data analysis problems
(supported by SSTF) and Dr. Kwak from Univ. of Georgia will continue his
research on data privacy (supported in part by BK21 and by NRF).</p>
<p>2021-07-08. After years of waiting, “Uniqueness questions in a
scaling-rotation geometry on the space of symmetric positive-definite
matrices” is accepted for publication in <em>Differential Geometry and
its Applications</em>. This manuscript is part II of <a
href="http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ejs/1491292817">the 2017 EJS
paper</a>, in which we addressed only 2 x 2 and 3 x 3 matrices. The
current paper addresses dimensions <span class="math inline">\(p\ge
4\)</span>. The link to this article is <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.difgeo.2021.101798">here</a>.</p>
<p>2021-06-02. An R package <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ClusTorus/index.html">ClusTorus</a>
is available at CRAN. The contents in this package include the functions
for the AOAS article (see below), and an improved, and extended, version
of mixture model-based clustering for the multivariate angular data. All
credits go to Seungki Hong. We are preparing an article introducing this
R package and its use.</p>
<p>2021-03-22. An article discussing clustering the dihedral angles on
the torus is accepted for publication in <em>The Annals of Applied
Statistics</em> (AOAS). This article stems from an undergraduate intern
report by Kiho Park. With a help of Dr. Byungwon Kim (now at KNU), the
article discusses methods of clustering on the torus, and reveals a
difference among the clustering structures of glycoprotein backbone
angles from SARS-CoV-2 and those from other strains of
coronaviruses.</p>
<p>2021-03-03. [Closed] I have an opening for a <a
href="./papers/Wanted.html">postdoctoral researcher</a>, at least one
new master’s student, and one new master-Ph.D combined student at my
lab.</p>
<p>2021-03-03. We have launched a new website for the lab: <a
href="https://statlet.github.io">https://statlet.github.io</a></p>
<p>2021-01-23. My paper “Geodesic projection of the von Mises-Fisher
distribution for projection pursuit of directional data” <a
href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/electronic-journal-of-statistics/volume-15/issue-1/Geodesic-projection-of-the-von-MisesFisher-distribution-for-projection-pursuit/10.1214/21-EJS1807.full">(link)</a>
is accepted for publication in <em>Electronic Journal of
Statistics</em>. This answers a fundamental question in directional
statistics: If a von Mises-Fisher distributed random direction is
projected onto a geodesic, it is still von Mises distributed?</p>
<p>2020-12-19. The manuscript <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14831">“Covariance-engaged
Classification of Sets via Linear Programming”</a> is accepted for
publication in <em>Statistica Sinica</em>. This work studies sparse
estimations for “set classification” and their theoretical properties.
It was conceived by Xingye and myself about five years ago, but a real
development began after Zhao joined the team.</p>
<p>2020-10-19. I, Mark and Steve wrote a response to a letter to the
editor in <em>The Annals of Applied Statistics</em> (AOAS). The letter
comments on the EM algorithm we used in our 2011 AOAS paper. We thought
a proper response was due. This letter will appear in AOAS. (It appeared
in two months: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/20-AOAS1411">Here</a>
is the link.)</p>
<p>2020-10-06. I am selected to receive a prestigious five-year <a
href="http://www.samsungstf.org/ssrfPr/researcher/viewResearcher.do?idx=444&amp;pageIndex=1&amp;searchCondition=all&amp;searchKeyword=%EC%A0%95%EC%84%B1%EA%B7%9C&amp;searchResearchProgram=%EA%B8%B0%EC%B4%88%EA%B3%BC%ED%95%99&amp;searchResearchDepth1=&amp;searchResearchDepth2=&amp;searchResearchBelong=&amp;searchResearchSelectYear=&amp;searchResearchState="><strong>research
grant from Samsung Science &amp; Technology Foundation</strong></a>. The
proposed topic is on generalizations of multi-source integrative factor
models and statistical inference.</p>
<p>2020-09-22. The manuscript “<a
href="https://doi.org/10.5705/ss.202019.0400">Adjusting systematic bias
in high dimensional principal component scores</a>,” written by myself
is accepted for publication in <em>Statistica Sinica</em>.
<em>Statistica Sinica</em> is notorious for its long interval between
the acceptance and print.</p>
<p>2020-08-30. A video explaining my research interest is on <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhlLZix8JPI">YouTube</a>. This is
a part of the CNS series of promoting research agendas. Intended viewers
are prospective graduate students.</p>
<p>2020-08-07. The manuscript “<a
href="https://doi.org/10.1111/biom.13352">Covariate-driven factorization
by thresholding for multi-block data</a>” is accepted for publication in
<em>Biometrics</em>. This work is written by Xing (my former PhD
student), Sungwon (again my former PhD student), Gen and myself and is a
major part of Xing’s doctoral dissertation.</p>
<p>2020-06-26. The manuscript “Covariance-engaged Classification of Sets
via Linear Programming” by Zhao, Xingye and myself is now on <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14831">arXiv</a>.</p>
<p>2020-02-20. The manuscript “Kurtosis test of modality for
rotationally symmetric distributions on hyperspheres,” by Byungwon,
Joern and myself, is accepted for publication in <em>The Journal of
Multivariate Analysis</em>. <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047259X19306141">(link)</a>
This work is part of Byungwon’s PhD dissertation, but changes since then
are enormous. The issues addressed and raised in this paper lead to a
promising research direction on projection pursuit for directional
data.</p>
<p>2019-09-06. I have received <a
href="./pictures/2019_9_teaching_award.jpg"><strong>Excellence in
Teaching Award</strong></a> from the College of Natural Science.
Thanks!</p>
<p>2019-08-08. I am now an associate editor of <em>Computational
Statistics &amp; Data Analysis</em>.</p>
<p>2019-02-20. I am selected to receive a five-year <strong>mid-career
research grant from National Research Foundation</strong>. The proposed
topic is on high-dimensional and non-Euclidean statistics.</p>
<p>2018-12-18. The manuscript “Small sphere distributions for
directional data with application to medical imaging” by Stephan, Joern,
Byungwon and myself is accepted for publication in <em>Scandinavian
Journal of Statistics</em>. <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1111/sjos.12381">(link)</a> This work began its
life in 2015 from a query from Steve Marron (Is there a parametric
distribution for small-circle behavior of data?). Stephan and I sent a
preliminary version of this to a conference, then decided not to
publish. Byungwon took over and has created a nice family of
distributions on hyperspheres, called “Small sphere distributions”. This
is a part of his PhD dissertation.</p>
<p>2018-10-30. My contribution to the Korean Statistical Society
newsletter is now in print. It’s about data science education (from the
statistical perspective) and is written in Korean. You can see it <a
href="http://www.kss.or.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=newsletter&amp;wr_id=113">here</a>
but the online version is only for members.</p>
<p>2018-10-10. As a new faculty member of Seoul National University, I
did an interview introducing myself <a
href="http://science.snu.ac.kr/bbs/view.php?board_id=kor_profnews&amp;idx=311&amp;m=4&amp;gul_no=6817&amp;page=1">(link)</a>.</p>
<p>2018-10-09. The manuscript “Penalized Orthogonal Iteration for Sparse
Estimation of Generalized Eigenvalue Problem” by Prfessors Jeon and Ahn,
and myself, is accepted for publication in <em>Journal of Computational
and Graphical Statistics</em>. <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2019.1568014">(link)</a></p>
<p>2018-09-01. I have officially joined the department of Statistics at
Seoul National University.</p>

<div id="badnews" class="section level1">
<h1>BadNews</h1>
<p>2022-11-17. I was not selected to be a member of Young Korean Academy
of Science and Technology. Disappointed, but okay.</p>
<p>2022-05-11. My team and I were not selected to receive a research
grant from IITP on an application of differential privacy. In addition,
a different team including me was not selected to receive a basic
research lab grant from NRF on the statistical foundation of
differential privacy.</p>
<p>2020-10-22. I have decided not to pursue a publication of Lee and
Jung (2017). This paper is part of Sungwon’s doctoral dissertation, and
has been considered for a couple of journals with mixed responses. The
work has drawn some attention from researchers (with nontrivial Google
Scholar citation numbers). The effort I need to put in to publish this
in an established journal outweighs the merit of the paper. This paper
will remain as an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01775">arXiv</a>
paper.</p>
